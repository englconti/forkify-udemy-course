# forkify Project

Recipe application with custom recipe uploads.

Project developed during the course from Udemy "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!".

The architecture chosen was the Model-View-Controller (MVC). Using the controller.js as a bridge between the Views (user-interface) and the Model(state/data).

All major design and idea of the project is from Jonas Schmedtmann, the creator and professor of the course.

My commits and personal implementations in the project are:

- Error message window trying to add/reduce more servings than the allowed values (1 and 20).
- Current Page and maximum number of pages display at the pagination.
- Error window when trying to input wrong ingredients format on Add Recipe.
- Succefull message window when uploading a new recipe.
